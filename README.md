## Local Development

### First-time Setup

The add-on setup steps come from the [extension dev page] on MDN. Look there for more details.

1. Clone this repo locally: `git clone git@github.com:mozilla/universal-search`
1. Install the [devprefs add-on] to enable some Firefox prefs useful for add-on development.
1. Create a [proxy file] to link your local copy of the code to your add-on development profile.

## Coding conventions

- lib/universal-search.js loads code into windows and constructs the object graph
- use constructors to assign dependencies to the object, and bind `this` to callbacks
- use `init` for initialization work other than dependency injection
- use `destroy` to unset anything that could leak memory
- leading underscore in prototype methods indicates private API
- event naming convention: hyphenated lower case.
	- we don't need to namespace it to individual items because it's such a small list of events. just keep it simple.

## Pubsub events

Events that flow through the global event broker (`app.events`, invoked as
`this.events` by individual modules):

#### `urlbar-change`

When the user types a printable key in the urlbar, the complete string in
the urlbar is fired as the body of this event.

```
{
  query: 'the mar'
}
```

- query: unicode string contents of the urlbar
